# Event Scheduler

This project is designed to enhance your skills in React by building an application that interacts with real data via a RESTful API. Unlike previous projects where data was stored in localStorage or sourced from APIs like the Pokemon API or Movie DB, this application will involve creating, reading, updating, and deleting data using a RESTful API.
